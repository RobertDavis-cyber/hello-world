                <p>HTML is the abbreviation of Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard language for tagging contents for web browsers.

                    HTML is represented by “Elements”. Elements are also known as Tags. Web browsers can only render a website when it is written in their supported language. HTML is the most common markup language and has the highest acceptance to web browsers.</p>
